# Quantum Solace

## Context

We are students at Epitech and we've follow a course about Quantum computation. We had to do a project so we decided to mix our skills in classical IT and what we just learned in this course.

## Purpose

This project is a pedagogy based game where you can play with quantum gates and make circuits and so test your skills in quantum algorithms.

This project is using a API which is using the library Qiskit. So we're evaluating your quantum circuit on a quantum environment.

## Build Setup

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/davidzeng8/QuantumSolace

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run start

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
